✅ Final Visual Update: HarrisWildlands Visual Directives (2025)

Here’s our polish pass — clarified for current system state and final build.

🎨 COLOR PALETTE
✅ Keep current core logic:

Cyan (Core/Operations)

Amber (LifeOps/Roots)

Violet (ThinkOps/Canopy)

Refinement:

Use muted, earth-integrated variants — no neons

Add supporting tones: moss green, bark brown, off-white paper, silver-gray

Core/Console areas can include silver-glyph detailing for subtle sophistication

🎞️ ANIMATIONS
Minimal but meaningful. We want classy, system-aligned movement, not spectacle.

✅ Include:

Hover pulses (sap logic, node glow)

Page transitions that feel like flowing across layers (e.g. root to canopy)

Single standout motion element on BruceOps (e.g. glowing “Enter the Wildlands” button with soft data-thread animation)

🚫 Avoid:

Bouncing, zoom-ins, floating cards, or any attention-seeking UI animations

Use animation to reinforce structure, not just aesthetics.

🖼️ IMAGERY
Yes — images are pre-generated and mapped:

BruceOps: Forest-root gateway (already themed)

Core: Trunk merged here — use “trunk + console” image

LifeOps: Use Root visuals (underground, sensors, grounding)

ThinkOps: Use Canopy visuals (hypotheses, field labs, complexity)

Visual treatment:

Use subtle overlays, parallax, or slice-based crops for responsiveness

Make sure images still breathe — no harsh masks or hard cutouts

🌐 PRIORITY PAGES
Most in need of polish:

BruceOps: Make this feel like a true living entry point

One or two standout effects only

Maybe a subtle portal pulse at the root or data-thread animation

ThinkOps: Visuals are strong — could use overlay scaffolding to guide thought process or track interaction

Console/Core: Feels solid — just lightly enhance with thematic textures (resin, fiber grid)

💻 CONSOLE AESTHETIC (Core)
✅ Keep MS-DOS foundation, but allow for gentle modern infusion:

Embedded textures (bark lines, glyph grids, sapflow outlines)

Slight animation of active terminal lines or command flashes

Keep UI text aligned left, monospace, systemic

The console is a living root terminal, not a retro novelty.

🌗 DARK / LIGHT MODE

Dark mode is primary.

Light mode can exist as a passive mirror, with calm parchment tones

Avoid stark contrast — aim for natural light, not white

🧭 FINAL NOTES

Every element should grow from the system, not float on top

A single moment of surprise per page is more powerful than a dozen animations

This isn’t sci-fi flash — it’s calm intelligence grown in soil and stewardship

Let’s finish this system like we started it — with clarity, density, and love. 🌲🤝
