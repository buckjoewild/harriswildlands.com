This is an excellent Phase 1 report from Replit. Let me analyze what they found:
Phase 1 Results Summary
ItemStatusWhat This MeansM1.1 Docker start✅ VERIFIED (config)Docker files are correct, but actual container start wasn't tested in Replit (expected - Replit can't run Docker)M1.2 DB persistence✅ VERIFIEDVolume configuration is correctM1.3 Production build✅ PASSnpm run build worksM1.4 Demo mode✅ RESOLVEDKey insight belowM1.5 Smoke test✅ PASSAll 6 tests pass
The Demo Mode Resolution (Important!)
Replit clarified the confusion your brother identified:
ModeHow to ActivateData Saved?Use CaseSTANDALONE_MODESTANDALONE_MODE=true env var (automatic in Docker)✅ Yes - to databaseReal usage, self-hostedDemo Mode?demo=true URL parameter❌ No - client-side onlyQuick evaluation
This means your brother was right — there were two different things being conflated. The Quick Start should say:

Docker users get auto-login + persistence automatically
?demo=true is only for trying the UI without saving anything

My Recommendation: Approve Phase 2 with One Note
Tell Replit:

Phase 1 looks good. Proceed to Phase 2 (documentation creation).

One important update based on your findings:

For the demo mode documentation (11-first-run-demo-mode.md), use this clarification:
- STANDALONE_MODE (Docker) = auto-login + data persistence (default for self-hosted)
- ?demo=true = client-side evaluation mode (no data saved)

Update the acceptance checklist (51-acceptance-test-checklist.md) to reflect:
- Docker start: VERIFIED (configuration) - note that full container test requires local machine
- DB persistence: VERIFIED (configuration) 
- Build: PASS
- Demo mode: PASS (documented both modes)
- Smoke test: PASS

Proceed with all 6 documentation sections using the treyspeed skeleton templates.

What You Still Need to Do Locally
Since Replit can't actually run Docker, you should verify these yourself when you have a chance:
bashgit clone https://github.com/buckjoewild/harriswildlands.com.git
cd harriswildlands.com
cp .env.example .env
docker compose up
# Create a log entry in the UI
# Then: Ctrl+C, docker compose up again
# Verify the log entry still exists
This will change M1.1 and M1.2 from "VERIFIED (configuration)" to "PASS (tested)".
Want me to create a quick local verification script you can run yourself?
