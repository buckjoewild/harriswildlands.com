"Build an enhanced version of my existing HarrisWildlands.com project (full-stack TS/Node/React app with PostgreSQL via Drizzle, already in my connected GitHub repo at https://github.com/buckjoewild/harriswildlands.com.git). Focus on adding a 'Family Steward' extension for small family systems: Private AI automation to analyze logs/checkins, detect drifts (e.g., low energy patterns), and suggest bond-strengthening activities (e.g., family walks if completion rates <40%), all while enforcing privacy red-zones (no sharing faith/family data without opt-in).Key Requirements:Use OpenRouter's free tier API for all AI calls (compatible with OpenAI SDK—install via npm if needed). Add to the AI ladder in routes.ts: Prioritize free models like 'meta-llama/llama-3.1-8b-instruct:free' or 'mistralai/mistral-nemo:free'. Wrapper function: Use process.env.OPENROUTER_API_KEY (add to .env.example). Fallback to off if limits hit. Prompts should prepend Bruce context for grounded, factual responses (no judgments).
Extend DB schema (schema.ts): Add 'familyMembers' table (id, userId FK, role string like 'parent/kid', privateSettings JSONB). Update CRUD routes for family-scoped logs/exports.
Integrate with external repo https://github.com/Treytucker05/DrCodePT-Swarm.git: Clone as a submodule in /family-steward (git submodule add). Bridge via Python service in Docker-compose: Run DrCodePT's autonomous loop (e.g., python -m agent.run --task 'Analyze family export JSON for drifts and suggest activities') on exported data. Use stdin/stdout or file artifacts (e.g., result.json) to pass back to TS app. Handle dependencies from requirements.txt (pip install in Docker). If full reference tricky, fallback to a simple Python wrapper calling OpenRouter directly.
UI Additions: Simple forms for adding family members, viewing aggregated drifts/suggestions. Use Radix/Tailwind for consistency.
Deployment: Update Dockerfile/docker-compose.yml for Python service (depends_on db/app). Ensure demo mode works without keys.
Free-Tier Safe: No paid APIs; limit calls to essentials. Test for resilience (e.g., mock exports).
Ambitious Features: Swarm delegation for sub-tasks (e.g., per-member analysis); output weekly family reports as text/PDF.
Output: Updated code in my repo branch 'family-openrouter'. Include README updates with setup (e.g., add OPENROUTER_API_KEY to Replit secrets). Verify with sample data: Persist a family log, run steward, get suggestions.

Base on keystone doc structure: Dual lanes, drifts factual, human agency. Build in hours—minimal viable."
