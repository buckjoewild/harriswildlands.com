🔥 Got it — 5 minutes because it’s richer, not because we slow-walk it. And yes: we’ll embed the addiction/habit-change science directly into the LifeOps daily log so the log runs the system, not just records it. ⚙️🌲

Below is the updated LifeOps Daily Log v2 (built to take ~5 minutes, max signal, low narrative). This is what you add to harriswildlands.com.

LifeOps Daily Log v2 (5-minute, science-integrated) 🎛️✅

0) The One Question (Core Outcome)

Followed the plan today? (Yes / No)

> This stays the “truth checkbox.” Everything else explains why.




---

1) Contingency Management (PRIMARY ENGINE) 🏆

These are the levers that make change stick.

Reward Earned? (Yes/No)

Reward Claimed Same-Day? (Yes/No)

What reward did I earn? (dropdown: Project Time / Chill Time / Hobby / Other)

Points Earned Today (number)

Suggested: 0–10 points, where “Followed plan = 10”


Streak (auto-calc; display only)


Design note for the site: show a tiny “Reward Contract” box at top:

> “If I follow the plan today, I earn: ____.”




---

2) Script Execution (CBT Minimal) 🔧

This is behavioral, not emotional.

Triggers encountered (checkboxes: Red / Yellow / Green)

Scripts used (0–5)

Did I run a script when triggered? (Yes/No)

Most-used script today (dropdown)

If No: “What was the gap?” (dropdown: Forgot / Too tired / Too fast / Alone / Environment leak)


Optional 1-liner:

“Next time, my script is: _________” (max 120 chars)



---

3) Sleep & Circadian Law (Infrastructure) 🌙

This is mandatory because it controls impulse and cravings.

Wake time held? (Yes/No)

Bedtime window held? (Yes/No)

Sleep duration (hours)

Sleep quality (slider 0–10)

Screens docked outside bedroom? (Yes/No)


Auto-flag on the page:

If sleep < 6.5 hours OR bedtime window missed → “High Risk Tomorrow” badge



---

4) Body Regulation (Nutrition + OTC Support) 🥗💧

Not “biohacking.” Just stabilizing the nervous system.

Protein-forward first meal? (Yes/No)

Hydration before noon? (Yes/No)

Caffeine cutoff held? (Yes/No) (set cutoff time in settings)

Movement (None / Light / Moderate / Hard)

OTC plan taken as intended (Yes/No)

Hunger stability (slider 0–10)



---

5) Mind & Urge Signal (Fast, honest) 🧠⚡

We track the state, not a story.

Urge intensity (peak) (0–10)

Stress load (0–10)

Impulse control (0–10)

Focus/clarity (0–10)

Anxiety/rumination (0–10)


Automatic interpretation (display):

High urge + low sleep = “Fix sleep & friction first”

High stress + low impulse control = “Run scripts + reduce choices”



---

6) Motivational Alignment (ANCHOR) 🧭✝️

This is your “why” check — quick but real.

Sliders (0–10):

Time in Word / prayer

Peace / steadiness

Integrity alignment

Service / love expressed


One forced-choice prompt (MI style):

Which value did I protect today? (dropdown: Faith / Family / Integrity / Health / Service / Leadership)


Optional 1 sentence:

“Today I chose ______ over ______.”



---

7) Environment Integrity (Phase 2 enforcement) 🧱

This is where we prevent “neutral environment = vice wins.”

Environment protected (no low-friction access)? (Yes/No)

Any environment leaks? (Yes/No) If Yes:

Leak type (checkboxes): Bedroom / Car / Phone / Store route / Alone-time / Money access

“Fix applied immediately?” (Yes/No)



---

8) Recovery Rule (only shows if “Followed plan = No”) 🛡️

When you mark No, the log becomes a containment tool, not a shame tool.

System resumed within next block? (Yes/No)

What is the next block script? (dropdown)

One friction upgrade I will apply now: (dropdown)

UI/Build Notes for harriswildlands.com (so it feels 🔥)

Make it fast

Sliders default at 5, quick tap

Yes/No as big toggle buttons

Most fields optional except the “Core Outcome” + “Sleep” + “Reward”


Make it intelligent

Auto-highlight the one most important fix each day:

Sleep missed → fix sleep

Reward missed → fix reinforcement

Environment leak → patch leak

Script not used → simplify scripts



Make it rewarding

When “Followed plan = Yes” → show a “Claim Reward” animation + streak



---

How to proceed (tonight) 🚀

Spec → Build → Verify → Ship

Spec

Implement this as Daily Log v2 and keep your old log as “v1 archived.”


Build

Add sections in this exact order (top-down: outcome → reward → scripts → sleep → body → mind → spiritual → environment).


Verify

Confirm: entry saves + loads + weekly summary counts:

YES days

reward claimed rate

sleep adherence rate

environment leak count

scripts used total



Ship

Link it from LifeOps homepage with a big button: “Run Today’s Log (5 min)”



---

3 next actions (≤ 30 min) ⏱️

1. Add CM block (reward earned/claimed + points) to the log UI.


2. Add Script Execution block (scripts used + gap reason) to the log UI.


3. Add conditional Recovery Rule section that only appears when “Followed plan = No”.



Definition of Done ✅

You can complete a log entry with: Outcome + Reward + Scripts + Sleep, it saves, and the app shows a weekly dashboard with the 5 counts above.
