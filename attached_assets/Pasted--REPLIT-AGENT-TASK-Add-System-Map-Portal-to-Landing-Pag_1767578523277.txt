# REPLIT AGENT TASK: Add System Map Portal to Landing Page

## MISSION
Add a "System Map" page to HarrisWildlands that serves as a beautiful documentation portal. This is a READ-ONLY static page—no database changes, no new endpoints, just a new React page with the content below.

## WHAT TO BUILD

### 1. Create New Page: `/client/src/pages/SystemMap.tsx`

This page should display a beautiful, dark-themed system documentation portal. Use the existing app's styling patterns (Tailwind, shadcn components if available) but make it feel special—this is the "know what you built" page.

### 2. Add Route in `/client/src/App.tsx`

Add a route for `/system-map` that renders the SystemMap component.

### 3. Add Navigation Link

Add "Map" or "System" to the main navigation (wherever the other nav links live—probably in Layout.tsx or a Nav component).

---

## PAGE CONTENT STRUCTURE

The SystemMap page should have these sections:

### HERO SECTION
```
Title: "Know What You Built"
Subtitle: "A living map of HarrisWildlands—your personal operating system for tracking life, capturing ideas, and building resilience through self-knowledge."

Status Pills (visual indicators):
- API Online (green dot)
- Database Connected (green dot)  
- AI Ready (blue dot)
- 100 calls/day quota (amber dot)
```

### SECTION 2: THE THREE LANES
Cards for each lane:

**LifeOps 🌱**
- Purpose: Daily logging with morning and evening check-ins
- Features: Sleep, hydration, energy, stress, habits, drift factors, reflection
- Key insight: 50+ tracking points, AI-powered weekly synthesis

**ThinkOps 💡**
- Purpose: Capture ideas without contaminating the daily ledger
- Features: Quick capture, who it helps, pain it solves, excitement/feasibility scores
- Key insight: Optional AI "reality check" for validation

**Goals 🎯**
- Purpose: Track commitments at Trunk (big rocks) and Leaves (weekly) levels
- Features: Domain-based organization, weekly minimums, progress tracking
- Key insight: Aggregated in weekly review

### SECTION 4: COST PROTECTION
Show these 4 stats in cards:

- **$0.10** — Average Monthly Cost
- **100** — Daily Quota (Calls)
- **24hr** — Cache Duration
- **10/min** — Rate Limit

### SECTION 5: THE PHILOSOPHY
4 principle cards:

**01 — Witnessing, Not Measuring**
You're not optimizing yourself. You're seeing yourself clearly over time. The goal is acceptance and clarity, not perfection.

**02 — Resilience, Not Immunity**
Self-knowledge doesn't make you bulletproof. It shortens the drift-to-correction cycle. You catch yourself faster.

**03 — Privacy-First, Local-First**
Your data stays on your machine. No cloud sync. No third-party analytics. AI is optional and you control what it sees.

**04 — Faith, Family, Teaching**
These are the non-negotiable domains. The system exists to serve them, not to optimize them away.

### SECTION 6: ALTERNATE PATHS (What's Next)
List of future possibilities with status badges:

**🧪 A/B Testing Yourself** — Status: READY TO BUILD
Run 7-day experiments on yourself. Get results with honest uncertainty ranges, not fake confidence.

**📜 Sacred Data Export** — Status: READY TO BUILD
Generate a beautiful year-end PDF that tells your story using your data.

**🌊 Monthly Micro-Synthesis** — Status: PLANNED
A 2-page monthly reflection bridging daily logs and annual export.

**🔗 Cross-Domain Correlations** — Status: EXPLORING
Auto-discover hidden patterns across LifeOps, ThinkOps, and Goals.

**🎓 Teaching Assistant** — Status: EXPLORING
Generate lessons and materials for your classroom.

**🏕️ HarrisWildlands Content Studio** — Status: EXPLORING

## STYLING GUIDANCE

- Use the app's existing dark theme
- Make it feel like documentation but beautiful
- Use monospace fonts for code/endpoints
- Add subtle animations on scroll if easy
- Status pills should have pulsing dots
- Cards should have hover states
- Make it responsive (works on mobile)

---

## WHAT NOT TO DO

- ❌ Don't create new database tables
- ❌ Don't create new API endpoints
- ❌ Don't modify existing pages
- ❌ Don't add new dependencies unless absolutely necessary
- ❌ Don't break existing navigation

---

## SUCCESS CRITERIA

- [ ] `/system-map` route loads
- [ ] Navigation has link to System Map
- [ ] All sections render correctly
- [ ] Mobile responsive
- [ ] No console errors
- [ ] Doesn't break any existing functionality

---

## TIME ESTIMATE

This should take 15-25 minutes. It's a single static page with no backend changes.

---

## QUOTE TO INCLUDE SOMEWHERE

> "Building resilience through self-knowledge. Not measuring yourself—witnessing yourself."

That's it. Ship it! 🚀
