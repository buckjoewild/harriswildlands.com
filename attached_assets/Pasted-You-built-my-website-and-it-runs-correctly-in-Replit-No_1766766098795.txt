You built my website and it runs correctly in Replit. Now I need a standalone, portable version I can run outside Replit (locally and on another host) with the SAME behavior.

Create a single “Keystone Standalone Document” (in Markdown) that includes:

1) App Identity
- App name, purpose, main features
- Current runtime stack (frontend framework, backend framework, database, auth, storage)
- Exact versions (Node/Python/etc) and package managers used

2) Project Inventory (What files are required?)
- Print the full directory tree
- Identify the “must have” files/folders to run the app
- Identify optional/dev-only files
- List all environment variables required (names, descriptions, examples)
- List all secrets and where they are expected to be injected (DO NOT print real secret values)

3) How to Run Standalone (Local)
- Step-by-step instructions from a blank machine:
  a) prerequisites (Node/Python/Docker/etc)
  b) install commands
  c) database setup/migrations/seed steps
  d) how to create the .env file
  e) how to start in dev mode
  f) how to build and start in production mode
- Include exact commands that work for THIS project

4) How to Deploy Standalone (Non-Replit)
Provide two deployment paths:
- Option A: Docker (preferred)
  - create Dockerfile(s) and docker-compose.yml if needed
  - include volumes, ports, env var injection, database container if used
- Option B: Traditional host (VM/VPS)
  - Nginx reverse proxy example config if applicable
  - systemd service file example if applicable
  - how to set env vars securely

5) Data & External Services
- What database is used (SQLite/Postgres/etc), where the DB file lives or connection string format
- Any external providers (auth, email, storage, OpenRouter/OpenAI, etc)
- How to swap providers safely

6) Build Artifacts / Export Package
- Tell me exactly what to download/export from this Replit project so I can run it elsewhere.
- If there are build outputs (dist/, build/, .next/, etc) explain when they are generated and whether they should be included or rebuilt.

7) “Parity Checklist”
- A checklist to verify the standalone build matches the Replit version:
  - routes work
  - login works
  - database persists
  - PDF export works (if included)
  - no missing env vars

DELIVERABLES:
A) Provide the Keystone Standalone Document as a single Markdown file named:
   harriswildlands-standalone-keystone.md

B) Create or update these files in the repo if missing:
- README.md (short)
- .env.example
- Dockerfile (or Dockerfile(s))
- docker-compose.yml (if needed)

Important constraints:
- Do not hand-wave. If you don’t know something, inspect the existing project files and config and then answer.
- Keep the instructions accurate to THIS repo structure.
- Never include real secret values in outputs.
