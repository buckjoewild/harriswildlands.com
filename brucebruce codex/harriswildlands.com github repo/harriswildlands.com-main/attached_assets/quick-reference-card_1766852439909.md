**Key feature:** Pulls from your logs/ideas/goals automatically

**Example Conversation:**
```
You: "How am I doing on my goals?"

Bruce: You're at 68% completion this week - solid, 
but faith domain had zero check-ins. The pattern 
shows you skip morning routines on chaotic days.

You: "What should I focus on?"

Bruce: Park 3 of your 10 ideas. You're idea-rich 
but execution-starved. Pick the 2 with highest 
feasibility scores and promote those.

---

## 🚨 RED FLAGS TO WATCH

### If you see these, STOP:
- 🚩 Using chat for therapy/emotional support
- 🚩 Relying on AI instead of making decisions
- 🚩 Running reality checks on every tiny idea
- 🚩 Generating 5+ weekly insights (cached anyway)
- 🚩 Asking chat about family/faith directly

### Healthy usage looks like:
- ✅ AI shows patterns, you decide actions
- ✅ Weekly review informs, doesn't dictate
- ✅ Reality checks filter noise, not replace judgment
- ✅ Chat answers questions, doesn't solve problems

---

## 🔧 TROUBLESHOOTING

### "Reality check says 'Park' but I love this idea"
**That's the point.** Love ≠ Feasibility. Park it, revisit in 3 months.

### "Weekly insight suggests something I can't do"
**Ignore it.** AI doesn't know your constraints. Use drift flags instead.

### "Teaching lesson includes activities I can't do"
**Edit it.** AI gives you 80% done. You bring the 20% (your classroom reality).

### "Chat gives wrong info about my data"
**Refresh the page.** It caches context. Or just correct it in follow-up.

---

## 📈 METRICS TO TRACK

### After 1 month, measure:
1. **Idea quality:** % of promoted ideas that shipped
2. **Goal completion:** Did drift flags help?
3. **Teaching time:** Hours saved on prep
4. **Chat utility:** Did it answer your questions?

### Good outcomes:
- 50%+ of reality-checked ideas Park/Discard (filtering works)
- 10%+ improvement in goal completion (insights work)
- 30%+ reduction in teaching prep time (lessons work)
- 80%+ of chat queries answered satisfactorily (context works)
