You are building a production-ready web app called “LifeOps” with multi-user auth and strict data boundaries.

GOAL
Implement:
1) Personal Daily Logs (LifeOps) for each user
2) A Shared Devotional Log (separate artifact) that two users can both contribute to
3) Weekly summaries + drift flags OPTIONAL (but structure must support it)

NON-NEGOTIABLE PRIVACY RULES
- Each user owns their own logs. No user can view another user’s personal logs.
- Shared Devotional entries are visible only to members of that household.
- Never show raw transcripts (this app is checkbox + scale logging only).
- Do not build “always-on visibility” between spouses.

APP PAGES
- /login, /register
- /dashboard (today’s status + quick actions)
- /log/new (Daily Log form)
- /logs (list + filter by date + domain)
- /devotional (shared devotional list)
- /devotional/new (shared devotional form)
- /settings/household (invite spouse, join via invite code)
- /weekly (simple weekly view, optional)

DATA MODEL (Postgres)
Users:
- id (uuid)
- email (unique)
- password_hash
- display_name
- created_at

Households:
- id (uuid)
- name (nullable)
- created_at

HouseholdMembers:
- id
- household_id (fk)
- user_id (fk)
- role enum: 'member' | 'admin'
- created_at
(unique household_id + user_id)

Invites:
- id
- household_id
- invite_code (unique, short)
- expires_at
- used_by_user_id nullable
- created_at

DailyLogs:
- id (uuid)
- user_id (fk)
- log_date (date)
- log_type enum: 'morning'|'midday'|'evening'
- payload_json (jsonb)  <-- store the checkbox + scale fields
- created_at
(index user_id + log_date)

DevotionalEntries:
- id (uuid)
- household_id (fk)
- entry_date (date)
- together boolean

UI REQUIREMENTS
- Use the exact checkbox/scale templates below as the form fields.
- Keep typing minimal: most fields checkbox/radio, a few short text optional.

INVITE FLOW
- Household admin can generate invite_code
- Spouse creates account then enters invite_code to join household
- Once joined, both can view devotional entries

VERIFY
- Confirm user A cannot view user B DailyLogs.
- Confirm both can view DevotionalEntries for their household.
- Confirm mobile usability and that Core section can be completed in under 2 minutes.

SHIP
- Provide env vars, migrations, seed, and a simple README with run steps.
