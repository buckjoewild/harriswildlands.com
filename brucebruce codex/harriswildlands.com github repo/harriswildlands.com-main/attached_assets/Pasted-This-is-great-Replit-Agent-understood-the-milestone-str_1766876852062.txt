This is great — Replit Agent understood the milestone structure and is proposing tasks in the right order. Let me break down what they're suggesting and give you my recommendations:

My Recommendation: Approve with One Modification
Tell Replit to run the first 5 tasks (M1 verification) and report back with PASS/FAIL results before proceeding to documentation creation.
Here's what to say:

Yes, proceed with the task list in this order:

PHASE 1 (Do first, report results before continuing):
1. Check program starts all parts correctly (docker compose up)
2. Check data stays after restart (create log → restart → verify)
3. Verify final version works correctly (npm run build && npm start)
4. Decide how demo mode works (test both localhost:5000 and ?demo=true, tell me which one works)
5. Create simple check for system status (smoke-test.sh)

STOP after Phase 1 and show me:
- PASS/FAIL for each of the 4 verifications
- Which demo mode behavior is correct
- The smoke test script

PHASE 2 (Only after I approve Phase 1 results):
6-12. Create all documentation sections using the treyspeed skeleton templates

IMPORTANT: 
- Mark anything unverified as PENDING, not PASS
- Use the skeleton content from the treyspeed files as templates
- Don't invent behavior — if something isn't verified, say TBD

Why This Matters
If Replit runs all 12 tasks without stopping, you might end up with documentation that claims things work when they don't (like Docker start being marked PASS when it's actually broken).
The checkpoint after Phase 1 lets you:

See what actually works
Catch demo mode inconsistency before it's baked into 30 files
Make informed decisions about what to document as "working" vs "pending"

Cost Estimate Remains Valid
Replit's estimate of 15-25 task completions (or 10-15 if batched) is reasonable. With the Phase 1 checkpoint, you're looking at:

Phase 1: ~5 interactions
Phase 2: ~10-15 interactions
Total: Still within their 15-25 estimate

Want me to refine anything before you give Replit the green light?
