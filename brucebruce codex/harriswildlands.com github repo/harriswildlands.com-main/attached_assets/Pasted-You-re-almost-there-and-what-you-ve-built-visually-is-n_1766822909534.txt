You're almost there — and what you’ve built visually is next-level. Let’s **lock this into a tight, dev-ready Replit prompt** that:

* Anchors all visuals properly
* Keeps the site light and performant
* Makes the design usable and responsive
* Instructs the agent with clarity and flexibility

### 🌲 HarrisWildlands Visual Front-End Build — Prompt for Replit Agent

**Let’s build a lightweight, visually immersive, and highly usable front-end experience for [harriswildlands.com](http://harriswildlands.com).**

#### ✅ PROJECT OVERVIEW:

HarrisWildlands is a digital stewardship platform. Its aesthetic and structure are **rooted in forest systems, biological intelligence, and visual clarity**. The experience should feel like walking through a living, data-integrated forest.

### 🖼️ ASSET DELIVERY (Images Attached)

You will receive **12 full-resolution UI art images**, each ~1024x1792 (portrait), optimized for:

* Scrollable sections
* Background layers
* Thematic transitions
* Embedded UI components

🗂️ Save in `/assets/img/` as:

```
root-system-v1.webp
root-system-v2.webp
trunk-system-v1.webp
trunk-system-v2.webp
canopy-v1.webp
canopy-v2.webp
lifeops-dashboard-v1.webp
lifeops-dashboard-v2.webp
login-portal-v1.webp
login-portal-v2.webp
lab-viz-v1.webp
lab-viz-v2.webp
```

🛠 **To optimize**:

* Convert PNG → **`.webp`**
* Lazy load below the fold
* Avoid CSS filters; use native hues
* Use responsive `srcset` for scaling

### 🧭 PAGE STRUCTURE

| Page                | Visual Base                     | Notes                                 |
| ------------------- | ------------------------------- | ------------------------------------- |
| `/` (Landing)       | `trunk-system-v1` + `canopy-v1` | Stack or scroll transition            |
| `/login`            | `root-system-v2`                | Embed login panel into root system    |
| `/console`          | `lifeops-dashboard-v2`          | Feels like a tree ring command center |
| `/lab`              | `lab-viz-v2`                    | Field station and data overlay        |
| `/map` *(optional)* | `canopy-v2` + `login-portal-v1` | World map or networked root nodes     |

### 🎨 VISUAL SYSTEM RULES

✅ Use image **as system architecture**, not decoration
✅ Avoid flat UI/UX styles
✅ Match UI to the image (bark panels, root inputs, resin-glass modals)
✅ UI elements **embed** into shapes and layers, not float in boxes
✅ Typography = scientific field notes, not startup glossy
✅ No dark mode — use soft light, natural tints only

---

### 🧩 UI ELEMENTS TO BUILD

1. **Login Panel** (in root)

   * Fields: Email, Key, "Link to Root"
   * Style: Glowing bark-inset
   * Position: Lower third of `root-system-v2.webp`

2. **Trunk Console**

   * Tabs: `Systems Map`, `Protocols`, `Logs`, `Loops`
   * Embed UI in trunk ring or data lines
   * Visuals animate subtly (e.g. sap flow)

3. **Sensor Dashboard Overlay**

   * Use `lab-viz-v1.webp`
   * Hoverable tooltips, micrographs, data pulses
   * Panel asks: “What are we testing today?”

4. **LifeOps Dashboard**

   * Use `lifeops-dashboard-v2.webp`
   * Time cycles, charts, logs visualized in tree ring format
   * Use radial graphs + flowing inputs

---

### ⚙️ TECHNICAL HINTS

* Use `.ts` (TypeScript) for all interactive logic
* You can mock sensor data for now (`data/seed.json`)
* Use `css clip-path` or SVG masks for curved UI panels
* Avoid generic frameworks — use **Tailwind with heavy theming** if needed
* Animate microinteractions with CSS (ripples, pulses, sap drips)

---

### ✅ GOAL

Build a **fully integrated, responsive UI** that looks and feels like a forest-embedded system — light enough to load fast, but **deep enough to feel sacred**.

All visual interactions should emerge from the world, not interrupt it.

Let the user feel they are not clicking through a site — but **stepping into a steward’s system**.

Let’s make this **lightweight**, **magical**, and **usable across all devices** — without compromising beauty, structure, or the principles of ecological intelligence.

Let me know when you're ready for:

* [ ] Starter `.ts` and `.css` files
* [ ] Iconography in SVG
* [ ] Font pairing based on scientific notes + botanical style
* [ ] Component library in Figma-style structure

This is the tree of systems. Let's build it right 🌱
