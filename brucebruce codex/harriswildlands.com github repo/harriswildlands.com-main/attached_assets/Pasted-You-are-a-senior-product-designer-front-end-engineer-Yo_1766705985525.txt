You are a senior product designer + front-end engineer. You will NOT rebuild core functionality unless needed — you will primarily (1) create a visually striking design system, (2) implement a premium UI skin, and (3) refine site structure for HarrisWildlands.com and the “Bruce” assistant portal.

PROJECT:
HarrisWildlands.com is the home base for “Bruce” — a personalized AI for a faith-centered father/teacher/creator. The site hosts three core modules:
- BruceOps (system cockpit / command center)
- LifeOps (stewardship lane: routines, logs, family leadership, consistency, private)
- ThinkOps (ideas lane: invention, learning, experiments, reality-checking, building)
The site should feel like: “A sacred-tech wilderness lab.” Science + wonder + love. Futuristic, but warm. High-integrity. Private by default.

PRIMARY DESIGN GOAL:
Create a visually unforgettable interface that looks like:
“An advanced AI operating system fused with a vintage botanical field journal.”
Think: ultra-clean sci-fi UI + etched botanical linework overlays + subtle sacred geometry + natural textures.
It must be beautiful, readable, fast, and responsive.

AESTHETIC DIRECTION (very specific):
1) Visual metaphor: “The Wildlands”
- Use subtle map/topographic contours, mycelium networks, constellation/starfield hints.
- Overlay delicate botanical engraving lines (leaf veins, roots, flowers, fungi) like a scientific plate drawing.
- Combine with crisp modern UI cards, glass-like panels, and precise grid layout.

2) Mood: “Sanctuary x Laboratory x Starship”
- Not spooky. Not edgy. Not occult. This is wonder + reverence + family warmth.
- Evoke awe, curiosity, peace, purpose.

3) Color system (dark-first):
- Base: obsidian/ink black with deep forest undertones
- Accents: aurora teal, bioluminescent green, electric violet, and “antique gold” highlights
- Use gradients sparingly, like an aurora or plasma glow behind key areas.
- Add a “Mode Switch” with 3 themes:
  - FIELD (earthy/forest, calmer)
  - LAB (cool/teal, analytical)
  - SANCTUARY (warm/gold, reverent)
The mode switch changes accent colors + background motif intensity.

4) Typography:
- Use a modern, highly legible sans for UI (clean, technical)
- Pair with a subtle serif (or small-caps) used sparingly for “principles / scripture-like” short lines
- Keep headings bold + crisp; body text comfortable.

5) UI components:
- A “Holo-Atlas” navigation (left sidebar or top nav) that feels like an interface map:
  Home, Bruce, LifeOps, ThinkOps, BruceOps, Library, About, Privacy
- Cards should have:
  - fine line borders
  - soft glow on hover
  - micro-texture (very subtle grain)
  - etched botanical corner ornaments (SVG, not heavy images)

6) Motion / micro-interactions:
- Smooth transitions, parallax background (very subtle)
- Hover reveals: faint glows + line-drawing “ink” animation
- Loading state: a “growing vine / forming circuit” animation (simple SVG)
- Avoid heavy 3D; keep performance excellent.

INFORMATION ARCHITECTURE (must implement):
HOME PAGE:
- Hero headline that feels like a manifesto:
  “Harris Wildlands”
  Subhead: “Faithful intelligence for family stewardship, wonder, and building.”
- 3 primary doors (large, gorgeous tiles):
  - Enter LifeOps (stewardship)
  - Enter ThinkOps (ideas)
  - Enter BruceOps (cockpit)
- A short “Why this exists” section (warm, grounded)
- A “Principles” strip (integrity, service, clarity, love, courage)
- Footer with Privacy-first statement: “Private by default. No sharing.”

BRUCE PORTAL PAGE (core):
- A premium chat interface that feels like a command console
- Left side: module tabs (LifeOps / ThinkOps / BruceOps)
- Right side: “Outputs” panel (saved summaries, PDFs, lesson-ready exports)
- Include a “Session Memory” indicator (local/private) and a “Red Zone Privacy” toggle.

LIFEOPS PAGE:
- Daily log flow (simple, fast)
- Weekly review
- Drift flags (patterns only; no preachy advice)
- Family leadership tools: routines, checklists, commitments

THINKOPS PAGE:
- Idea capture
- Reality check (Known / Likely / Speculation)
- Build pipeline: Spec → Build → Verify → Ship
- Project cards and experiments

BRUCEOPS PAGE:
- Settings and admin cockpit
- Model/provider selection (cheap default)
- Auth, transcript storage, export settings
- System status panel

NON-NEGOTIABLES:
- Accessibility: readable contrast, keyboard nav, ARIA labels, focus states
- Mobile responsive: phone-first usability
- Performance: keep it fast; prefer SVG/CSS effects over large images
- Privacy-forward UX: clear boundaries and local-first language

TECH IMPLEMENTATION:
- Use the existing stack in this Replit project (do not migrate unless necessary).
- If React is used: structure components cleanly; use a design system file for tokens.
- Create an SVG motif pack (botanical corners, root networks, sacred geometry lines) that can be reused across pages.
- Build theme tokens with CSS variables for the 3 modes (FIELD/LAB/SANCTUARY).
- Add tasteful animations (CSS or lightweight library if already installed).

DELIVERABLES:
1) A cohesive “visual design system” implemented in code (tokens + components).
2) Updated page layouts (Home + Bruce + LifeOps + ThinkOps + BruceOps) with the described vibe.
3) Polished navigation + mode switch.
4) Short in-code comments explaining where to adjust motifs/colors.

Before you finalize, do a quick self-check:
- Does this feel like “botanical science plate meets starship UI”?
- Is it reverent + warm (faith/family) without being cheesy?
- Is the UI intriguingly futuristic and unique (not a generic SaaS template)?
- Is it still fast and readable?
