You are a senior full-stack engineer building an MVP web app from attached requirements documents.

PROJECT NAME: BruceOps (working title)
MISSION: Turn the 4 lanes (LifeOps, ThinkOps, Bruce Teaching Assistant, HarrisWildlands) into a single modular app with strict guardrails and simple UX.

SOURCE OF TRUTH:
Use ONLY the attached docs as requirements:
- Lane 1 LifeOps Master Sheet
- Lane 2 ThinkOps Master Sheet
- Lane 3 Bruce Teaching Assistant Master Sheet
- Lane 4 HarrisWildlands Master Sheet
- Drift Detection System
- Life Operations Steward (processing rules)
(If present) Brother Collaboration Protocol + ThinkOps Purpose doc

NON-NEGOTIABLES (from docs):
- LifeOps outputs must be factual/pattern-based and avoid invented context; drift flags are observational only.
- ThinkOps must separate Known / Likely / Speculation and include a self-deception filter + decision bins.
- Teaching Assistant outputs must be standards-aligned, printable-ready, minimal prep, with a quality checklist.
- Red-zone privacy: support “summaries only” sharing; never assume raw logs should be shared.

TECH CONSTRAINTS:
- Use OpenRouter API for model calls. Read API key from environment variable OPENROUTER_API_KEY.
- Minimize token usage: cache outputs; re-run only when inputs change; prefer short structured outputs.
- Store data locally (SQLite) for MVP.
- Include a simple settings page for: chosen model, tone, and “Advice Mode default” (patterns only vs advice when asked).

MVP SCOPE (BUILD THIS FIRST):
Build ONLY these modules and screens:

1) Dashboard
- Buttons to enter each lane
- Shows “today status”: logs count, open loops count, any drift flags (if enough data)

2) LifeOps
- “Daily Log” form (Yes/No + 1–10 scales + 1–2 bullet lines) based on Lane 1
- Store each log entry with timestamp + fields
- “Daily Summary” generator: factual summary + signals + domain tags + open loops (per Life Operations Steward)
- “Drift Flags” view: run Drift Detection rules only when enough entries exist (per Drift Detection doc)

3) ThinkOps
- “Idea Capture” form (title, pitch, who it helps, pain, why I care, tiny test ≤7 days)
- “Reality Check” output: Known / Likely / Speculation + self-deception flags + Decision bin (discard/park/salvage/promote)
- “Spec → Build → Verify → Ship” panel for promoted ideas

4) Bruce Teaching Assistant
- Input form exactly like Lane 3 (grade, standards, topic, time, materials, constraints, assessment type, format)
- Output package exactly like Lane 3 default output + quality checklist

5) HarrisWildlands (MVP)
- Simple “Site Copy Generator” page: input the Core Message + Site Map + Lead Magnet fields, output draft copy for Home / Start Here / Resources based on Lane 4
(No e-commerce, no WordPress integration yet.)

QUALITY & SAFETY CHECKS (MUST IMPLEMENT):
- Every generated output must include a “Source Lock” note: “Based only on provided inputs.”
- Never fabricate user history or missing facts.
- Include a “Reality Check” section automatically for ThinkOps outputs.

DELIVERABLES:
1) A short architecture plan (data model + routes + components)
2) A working app with the above screens
3) A README with setup steps, environment variables, and how to run
4) Seed example data for one LifeOps day + one ThinkOps idea + one Teaching request

START BY ASKING ME UP TO 10 CLARIFYING QUESTIONS.
After questions, propose the MVP plan and begin implementation.
