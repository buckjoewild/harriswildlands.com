You are my Replit engineering agent. Build a LifeOps “Goal Tracking” MVP inside the existing HarrisWildlands/LifeOps app.

NON-NEGOTIABLES
- Private by default. Everything behind login/auth. No public access to any user data.
- No coaching, no therapy tone, no motivational speeches. Just tracking + factual summaries.
- Drift flags are observation-only, single sentence, include timeframe, no advice.
- Fast check-in: a user must be able to check in on today’s goals in < 60 seconds.

MVP FEATURES
1) Auth (use existing auth if present; otherwise implement email+password auth with hashed passwords).
2) Data Models (DB tables):
   - users: id, email, name, password_hash, created_at
   - domains: id, name (Faith, Family, Work, Health, Logistics, Property, Ideas, Discipline)
   - goals: id, user_id, domain_id, title, description, target_type (binary|count|duration), weekly_minimum INT, start_date, due_date, status (active|paused|archived), priority (1-3), created_at
   - checkins: id, goal_id, user_id, date (YYYY-MM-DD), done BOOLEAN, score_1_10 INT NULL, note TEXT NULL, created_at
   - drift_flags: id, user_id, type, timeframe_start, timeframe_end, sentence, created_at

3) UI
- /dashboard (auth required)
  - “Today” section: list active goals with 1-tap done/not done
  - Optional: score 1-10 + one-sentence note
- /goals
  - create/edit/archive goals
- /review/weekly
  - shows completion % by goal and by domain for last 7 days
  - shows drift flags (see rules)

4) Drift Rules (generate weekly, last 7 days)
- Check-in Dropoff: if missed checkins on 4+ days this week → “Goal check-ins were missed on 4+ days over the past week.”
- Consistency Drift: if completion rate < 40% → “Completion rate was below 40% over the past week.”
- Overload: if active goals > 7 and completion < 60% → “More than 7 active goals with reduced completion over the past week.”
- Domain Neglect: if a domain has goals but zero checkins → “No goal check-ins occurred for the <domain> domain over the past week.”
All drift flags must be ONE sentence, factual, include timeframe.

5) PDF Export
- Add “Export Weekly PDF” button on weekly review.
- PDF includes: week range, goals list, completion %, domain coverage, drift flags.
Keep it clean and structured.

TECH REQUIREMENTS
- Choose the simplest stack consistent with the existing project (Next.js/React preferred).
- Use a single DB (SQLite acceptable for MVP, Postgres if already configured).
- REST or Next API routes:
  - GET/POST /api/goals
  - PUT/DELETE /api/goals/:id
  - POST /api/checkins (bulk allowed)
  - GET /api/review/weekly
  - GET /api/export/weekly.pdf
- Add basic validation and error handling.
- Add a seeded “demo user” if requested and safe; never expose demo credentials publicly.

DELIVERABLES
- Working UI + DB migrations/seed
- README with: how to run, env vars, how to create demo user, how to export PDF
- Acceptance checklist:
  - create goal ✅
  - check in today ✅
  - weekly review + drift flags ✅
  - weekly PDF export ✅
  - incognito shows no data without login ✅
