# GENERATION INSTRUCTIONS (REPLIT AGENT)

You have direct access to this codebase. Use it.

1. **Read Every File Directly:** Use your file system access to read every file in the repository. Do not summarize - document completely.

2. **Start with these key files:**
   - `package.json` (versions, scripts, dependencies)
   - `shared/schema.ts` (all database tables)
   - `server/routes.ts` (all API endpoints)
   - `server/storage.ts` (all database methods)
   - `server/ai.ts` or equivalent (AI provider logic)
   - `client/src/App.tsx` (all routes)
   - `client/src/pages/*` (all page components)

3. **Output Format:** Generate as a comprehensive Markdown document saved to `/docs/TECHNICAL_MANUAL.md`

4. **Work in Volumes:** If output limits are hit, create separate files:
   - `/docs/manual/VOL1_OVERVIEW.md`
   - `/docs/manual/VOL2_TECH_STACK.md`
   - `/docs/manual/VOL3_ARCHITECTURE.md`
   - ... etc.

5. **Verify as you go:** After documenting each section, cross-reference against actual files.

6. **Commit when complete:** Stage and prepare for commit with message "docs: comprehensive technical manual v1.0"
```

## WHAT TO TELL REPLIT AGENT

**Planning Mode Prompt:**
```
I need you to generate a comprehensive technical project manual for this entire codebase. 

This will be the KEYSTONE DOCUMENT - the single source of truth that any developer or AI agent can reference to fully understand, operate, and extend this system.

The attached prompt describes an 18-volume structure covering:
- Executive overview & project identity
- Complete technology stack with versions
- Architecture documentation with diagrams
- Every file in the repository documented
- Complete database schema (all tables, all fields)
- All 24+ API endpoints with request/response schemas
- AI integration guide with prompts and cost analysis
- User workflows step-by-step
- Component and hook reference
- Configuration reference (all env vars)
- Deployment guides (Replit, Docker, local)
- Security audit
- Extension patterns (how to add pages, tables, endpoints, AI features)
- Troubleshooting guide
- Testing procedures
- Maintenance procedures
- Future roadmap
- Appendices with quick references

Read every file in this repository. Document everything. Miss nothing.

Output to /docs/TECHNICAL_MANUAL.md (or split into /docs/manual/ if needed).

Target: 300-500 pages equivalent in detail.
