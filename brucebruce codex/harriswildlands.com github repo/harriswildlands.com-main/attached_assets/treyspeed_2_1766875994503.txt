## Proposed `docs/` folder table of contents

This structure is designed to (1) preserve what already exists in your **Quick Start**  and **Keystone**  documents, (2) close the biggest documentation gaps surfaced by those two documents (backup/restore, security/LAN exposure, and demo-mode consistency), and (3) create clean “reading paths” for users vs operators vs developers.

# What each section contains (and exactly what it maps to)

## `docs/README.md`

**Purpose:** Single entry point for the repo docs: what this system is, who each doc set is for, and where to start.

* Links to the “reading paths” page.
* Links to Keystone v1.0 and Quick Start.

**Maps to:** The existence of both a beginner setup guide  and a comprehensive keystone technical reference .

---

## `00-start-here/`

### `00-overview-and-reading-paths.md`

**Purpose:** A short bridge between “how to run it” and “full technical keystone.”

Includes 3 reading paths:

1. **End user (standalone):** Quickstart → First run/demo → LifeOps → ThinkOps → Weekly → Export
2. **Operator (self-host):** Docker compose → env → persistence → updates → security → recovery
3. **Developer:** Architecture → schema → routes → auth → AI ladder → tests

**Maps to:**

* Quick Start is operational and beginner-focused 
* Keystone is full lifecycle / architecture / risk + acceptance testing 

### `01-glossary.md`

**Purpose:** Define the minimum terms so users aren’t forced into the keystone to understand the UI language.

Must include (at minimum):

* LifeOps, ThinkOps
* Drift flags/signals (and “signals not judgments”)
* Demo mode vs authenticated mode
* Export

**Maps to:** LifeOps/ThinkOps separation and drift as “signals, not judgments”  and the user-facing LifeOps/ThinkOps references in the Quick Start .

---

## `10-user-guide/` (what normal users need)

### `10-quickstart-standalone-docker.md`

**Purpose:** A Markdown version of your Quick Start guide, with the same step-by-step commands.

**Maps to:** Entire Quick Start document .

### `11-first-run-demo-mode.md`

**Purpose:** Make demo-mode behavior unambiguous and consistent.

* Keystone acceptance checklist references demo via `?demo=true`. 
* Quick Start implies demo is available at `http://localhost:5000` without further qualifier. 
  This doc reconciles that into one “do this first” instruction set, so beginners don’t conclude setup failed.

### `12-lifeops-daily-logging.md`

**Purpose:** Explain what daily logging captures and how to do it in <5 minutes.

**Maps to:** Quick Start “Daily Logging (LifeOps)” summary  and Keystone statement of minimal-input daily logging with persistence and scales/toggles .

### `13-thinkops-ideas-pipeline.md`

**Purpose:** Explain the “idea lane” and basic statuses (e.g., draft).

**Maps to:** Quick Start ThinkOps + status mention (“draft”)  and Keystone “idea pipeline with status tracking” .

### `14-weekly-review.md`

**Purpose:** Explain what `/weekly.pdf` produces and what it means.

* Quick Start says `/weekly.pdf` “makes a text file with stats.” 
* Keystone states weekly is text-based with PDF pending / stubbed. 

This doc standardizes that expectation and explains the outputs (completion rates/domain stats/drift flags) without overpromising.

### `15-export-and-personal-backups.md`

**Purpose:** A user-safe explanation of exporting and what to do with the JSON.

**Maps to:** Quick Start “Export Data: JSON file”  and Keystone “Exports: JSON bundle” .

Critically: this is where you add the missing *beginner* language about safe habits (“export cadence”), without inventing a restore feature that isn’t documented.

### `16-troubleshooting.md`

**Purpose:** Consolidate predictable beginner pitfalls into a checklist format.

**Maps to:** Quick Start troubleshooting (“restart, rebuild, Docker open”)  and Keystone health endpoint/testing mindset .

---

## `20-operator-guide/` (for people running it for real)

### `20-standalone-deployment-docker-compose.md`

**Purpose:** Operator-grade version of “docker compose up,” plus run modes, ports, and container expectations.

**Maps to:** Quick Start Docker Compose flow  and Keystone Docker/Compose deployment description .

### `21-configuration-env.md`

**Purpose:** What `.env` is, how `.env.example` is used, and what “AI off” means operationally.

**Maps to:** Quick Start `.env.example → .env` and “AI keys not needed”  plus Keystone AI ladder design and “off” fallback .

### `22-data-storage-and-persistence.md`

**Purpose:** Explain persistence expectations.

**Maps to:** Keystone use of PostgreSQL persistence  and Quick Start’s implication that it runs with a Postgres setup .

Also: this is where you address the keystone checklist “DB persist” verification status (it appears as a checklist item, not a declared PASS), without making claims beyond what the checklist states. 

### `23-updates-and-upgrades.md`

**Purpose:** Safe upgrade path:

* `git pull`
* rebuild flow
* when to export first

**Maps to:** Quick Start update instructions  and Keystone’s desire for iterative updates/change logs .

### `24-security-local-lan-and-auth-modes.md`

**Purpose:** Close the “LAN phone access” security gap.

**Maps to:** Quick Start “access from phone via IP”  and Keystone’s auth/fallback framing (Replit OIDC vs demo/standalone) .

This doc should answer:

* What modes exist (OIDC vs demo/standalone)
* What “private” means in local vs LAN contexts
* Operator best practices (without inventing new features)

### `25-healthchecks-and-basic-monitoring.md`

**Purpose:** How to verify it’s healthy and what “AI provider ladder” status implies.

**Maps to:** Keystone `/api/health` route description and acceptance tests .

### `26-disaster-recovery.md`

**Purpose:** Operator-grade recovery runbook:

* what to do if containers fail
* what to do if DB breaks
* how exports fit in

**Maps to:** Keystone emphasis on persistence/exports and operational handoff concepts  and Quick Start “export JSON” .

(If restore/import is not implemented, this doc should explicitly state that and define the current best practice: export-based backup + DB volume backup strategy, *as documented and verified*.)

---

## `30-developer-reference/` (for maintainers and contributors)

### `30-architecture-overview.md`

**Purpose:** A shorter, developer-readable version of the conceptual architecture.

**Maps to:** Keystone architecture section (dual-lane flow, DB, AI ladder, outputs) .

### `31-repo-layout.md`

**Purpose:** Explain the repo structure (client/server/shared, etc.) at a high level.

**Maps to:** Keystone repo tree section .

### `32-api-routes-reference.md`

**Purpose:** List routes and their meanings, especially:

* `/api/health`
* `/export`
* `/weekly.pdf`
* auth endpoints

**Maps to:** Keystone API routes overview  and user-facing `/weekly.pdf` mention in Quick Start .

### `33-database-schema-reference.md`

**Purpose:** Tables/entities and what they represent (logs/ideas/goals/checkins/driftFlags/etc.).

**Maps to:** Keystone schema list .

### `34-auth-replit-oidc-and-fallbacks.md`

**Purpose:** Explain the Replit OIDC path vs fallback behavior.

**Maps to:** Keystone authentication description .

### `35-ai-provider-ladder.md`

**Purpose:** Explain the ladder and what “off” means.

**Maps to:** Keystone AI ladder (Gemini → OpenRouter → Off)  and Quick Start “AI features will be off” without keys .

### `36-validation-and-testing-checklist.md`

**Purpose:** Put the PASS/Pending checklist into a stable doc that can be updated.

**Maps to:** Keystone acceptance checklist table .

---

## `40-protocols-and-governance/` (what keeps the system from drifting into “AI coach”)

### `40-lifeops-thinkops-separation.md`

**Purpose:** Codify the “lane separation” principles and what counts as operational truth vs ideation.

**Maps to:** Keystone’s core thesis of separation and anti-contamination .

### `41-drift-detection-signals.md`

**Purpose:** Define what drift flags are, what they aren’t, and the factual-language requirement.

**Maps to:** Keystone drift detection framing (“signals, not judgments”) and drift flag heuristics described .

### `42-privacy-red-zones-and-sharing-boundaries.md`

**Purpose:** Make “red-zones” and “family/faith boundaries” explicit and operational.

**Maps to:** Keystone privacy/red-zone constraints  and Quick Start privacy statement (family/faith stays private; not shared unless chosen) .

### `43-non-goals-and-safety-constraints.md`

**Purpose:** Keep non-goals visible so future contributors can’t accidentally violate them.

**Maps to:** Keystone non-goals and constraints section .

---

## `50-releases-and-evidence/` (keystone + changelog + proof artifacts)

### `50-keystone-v1.0-2025-12-27.md`

**Purpose:** Store the keystone report as a versioned artifact in docs, as the report itself recommends (git-tracked updates and change log discipline). 

### `51-acceptance-test-checklist.md`

**Purpose:** Separate checklist so it’s easy to update as items move from Pending → PASS.

**Maps to:** Keystone checklist section .

### `52-changelog.md`

**Purpose:** Single chronological log of doc+system changes (quarterly reviews recommended by the keystone). 

---

# Notes on accuracy and “no invented behavior”

* Where the documents imply something but don’t fully specify it (e.g., “demo mode” mechanics, Docker persistence verification, restore processes), the corresponding pages should be written with **explicit “Verified / Not yet verified / TBD” flags** rather than filling gaps with assumptions. This is consistent with the Keystone’s PASS vs Pending posture. 
* `/weekly.pdf` should be documented as producing a **text-based weekly output** (PDF pending/stubbed), because both docs characterize it that way.

---

If you want the next step, I can generate the **actual Markdown skeletons** for each file above (headers + standardized sections like Purpose/Audience/Verified-On/Applies-To/Steps/Troubleshooting), staying strictly within what these two documents already claim.
